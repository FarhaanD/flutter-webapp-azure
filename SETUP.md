# Guide to Setting Up Azure Resources for Flutter Web App

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and configure the necessary Azure resources for hosting a Flutter web application using Terraform. By following this guide, you will set up a comprehensive environment including a resource group, virtual network, container registry, and app service.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- Azure CLI installed and configured.
- Access to the repository containing the Terraform configurations.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, obtain the necessary Terraform configurations by cloning the repository. Replace `your-repository-url` with the actual URL of the repository:

```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
git clone your-repository-url
cd flutter-webapp-azure
```



### Step 2: Initialize Terraform

Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration files and initialize Terraform. This will download the required providers and initialize the backend.

```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
terraform init
```



### Step 3: Create a Terraform Workspace (Optional)

If you are managing multiple environments (e.g., staging, production), create a new Terraform workspace:

```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
terraform workspace new dev
```



### Step 4: Review the Plan

Before applying the changes, review the Terraform plan to understand what resources Terraform will create, modify, or destroy:

```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
terraform plan
```



### Step 5: Apply the Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the resources on Azure. This step will prompt you to confirm the action before proceeding:

```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
terraform apply
```



### Step 6: Verify the Deployment

Once the Terraform apply is complete, you can verify the creation of resources through the Azure portal or using the Azure CLI:

```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
az resource list
```


## Conclusion

Upon completing these steps, your Azure environment will be configured with all the necessary resources to host and run your Flutter web application. Remember to manage your resources to avoid unnecessary Azure charges, especially if you are using a pay-as-you-go subscription.
