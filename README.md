you dont have any instructions how to run this terraform
why you putted it in the setupmd

store your tfstate in a blob storage or something secure
this way we can repeat the set up and its left intact

your resources should always following good naming convention standards
company abb = sn , ts , fs, cb, tl etc
# Architecture Overview of the Flutter Web App on Azure

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level architecture overview of a Flutter web application deployed on Azure. The system is designed to leverage Azure's cloud capabilities, including virtual networks, container registries, and app services to host a scalable and secure web application.

## System Architecture

The architecture is structured around several key Azure resources managed through Terraform, which ensures infrastructure as code practices, allowing for reproducible and consistent deployments. Below is a breakdown of the primary components and their relationships within the system.

### Terraform Configuration

- **Main Configuration (`infrastructure/main.tf`)**:
  - **Resource Group**: Serves as a container that holds related resources for the Azure solutions.
  - **Network Module**: Handles the networking aspects, creating a virtual network and a subnet.
  - **Container Registry**: Manages Docker container images, allowing for secure storage and management of container images.
  - **App Service Plan and App Service**: Hosts the web application, providing a fully managed platform.

- **Variables (`infrastructure/variables.tf`)**:
  - Defines all necessary parameters that can be configured externally to customize the Azure resources like names, location, and network settings.

- **Outputs (`infrastructure/outputs.tf`)**:
  - Exposes important information like the web app URL and the login server of the container registry, which can be useful for debugging and reference.

### Network Configuration

- **Network Main Configuration (`network/main.tf`)**:
  - **Virtual Network and Subnet**: Establishes an isolated network for the resources, ensuring secure communications between Azure services.

- **Network Variables (`network/variables.tf`)**:
  - Similar to the main variables file but scoped to networking resources.

- **Network Outputs (`network/outputs.tf`)**:
  - Provides identifiers for the virtual network and subnet, which are useful for integration with other Azure services.

### Important Entities

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: Used within Terraform to manage the lifecycle of Azure resources.
- **Azure App Service**: PaaS offering of Azure to host web applications, linked to a Docker container hosted in Azure Container Registry.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Manages private Docker registries on Azure, integrated with Azure Active Directory for security.

## Architectural Invariants

- **Separation of Concerns**: The infrastructure is clearly divided into networking and application hosting components. Each module handles a specific aspect of the architecture, ensuring that changes in one module do not affect others.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to be scalable, both from an infrastructure perspective (using Azure's scalability features in App Service) and application perspective (stateless design of the web app).
- **Security**: All network communications within the virtual network are isolated from external access, except where explicitly allowed.

## Boundaries and Interfaces

- **Terraform and Azure**: Terraform acts as the interface to Azure, abstracting the complexity of direct Azure resource management.
- **Container Registry and App Service**: The boundary between these services is defined by the Docker image storage and retrieval process, managed through Azure's native integration.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust framework for hosting a Flutter web application on Azure. By leveraging Terraform for infrastructure management and Azure services for application hosting and networking, the system is both scalable and secure. The modular design allows for easy updates and maintenance, ensuring long-term sustainability of the platform.
